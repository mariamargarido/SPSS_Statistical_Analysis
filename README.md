# SPSS_Statistical_Analysis
This project, developed as part of the Statistical Data Analysis course, integrates two interconnected projects that demonstrate the application of statistical methodologies to analyze and interpret complex datasets. 

The first project focuses on understanding coffee sales behavior across a retail chain, considering various influencing factors. The second project combines two analyses: evaluating passenger satisfaction for an airline, identifying the attributes that determine customer experience, and analyzing residential electricity consumption in a specific country, exploring its key determinants. 

Both projects utilized SPSS software to perform a range of statistical analyses, including Descriptive and Comparative Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests, Factor Analysis, and Multiple Linear Regression Models. These techniques enabled actionable insights to be derived from the data, supporting informed decision-making processes. 

Together, these projects highlight a strong command of statistical tools and techniques, the ability to extract meaningful insights from data, and a problem-solving approach applicable to a wide range of business challenges.
